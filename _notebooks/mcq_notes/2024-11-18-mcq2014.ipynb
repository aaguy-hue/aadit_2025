    "#### The Good\n",
    "- I didn't miss any questions in 5 out of the 8 tested units\n",
    "- I didn't miss any questions when it came to analyzing how correct a program was or conditions to produce some output\n",
    "  - I did okay on the other two skills as well, with an 80% to a 90% on them\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Bad\n",
    "- I struggled to notice when College Board put certain sneaky things into certain questions (like subtracting 1 from the end of a loop or starting at 1 in a loop to make things tricky)\n",
    "- I struggled with Skill 2.B and 2.C, both related to evaluating code and determining the output\n",
    "  - Skill 2.B: Determine the result or output based on statement execution order in a code segment without method calls (other than output).\n",
    "  - Skill 2.C: Determine the result or output based on the statement execution order in a code segment containing method calls.\n",
    "- I did very bad with certain topics\n",
    "  - Topic 2.7: String Methods\n",
    "  - Topic 2.9: Using the Math Class\n",
    "  - Topic 6.2: Traversing Arrays\n",

    "#### What I must do\n",
    "- I must practice my ability to **evaluate Java code by hand**\n",
    "  - How? I will do previous MCQs that have been released by College Board\n"
