    "# 2015 Practice Exam MCQ\n",
    "\n",
    "On the MCQ, I earned a 33/39 overall (84.61%). Here is an analysis of the problems I got wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, my issue was that I rushed the test and didn't know some of the intricacies of a few Java methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 15\n",
    "### Question\n",
    "![Screenshot of Question](https://i.ibb.co/d9hhwcZ/image.png)\n",
    "Consider the following method.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public static void showMe(int arg) {\n",
    "    if (arg < 10) {\n",
    "        showMe(arg + 1);\n",
    "    } else {\n",
    "        System.out.print(arg + \" \");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What will be printed as a result of the call `showMe(0)`?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solving the Problem\n",
    "If `arg` is less than 10, the number will simply be incremented until the number is 10, then that number will be printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**My Mistake**: I rushed this problem, so I didn't notice that it said `<` and not `<=`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What do I need to do in future?\n",
    "Spend more time on the questions to pay attention to small details.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 19\n",
    "### Question\n",
    "For which of the following conditions will nothing be printed?\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "int x = 1;\n",
    "\n",
    "while (/* condition */)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    if (x%2==0)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        System.out.print(x+\" \");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    x = x + 2\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The following conditions have been proposed.\n",
    "\n",
    "I: `x < 0`\n",
    "II: `x <= 1`\n",
    "III: `x < 10`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solving the Problem\n",
    "It's immediately clear that I and II are correct, since the while loop will never even reach 2, the first even number. However, realizing III is correct requires actually trying the loop and realizing that only odd numbers will be iterated on so the print will never be called.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What do I need to do?\n",
    "I have to actually go through the question and not just be lazy and quickly answer it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 25\n",
    "### Question\n",
    "What is printed as a result of executing the code segment?\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "int count = 0;\n",
    "\n",
    "for (int x = 0; x < 4; x++) {\n",
    "    for (int y = x; y < 4; y++) {\n",
    "        count++;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "System.out.println(count);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solving the Problem\n",
    "Basically, this counts like follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1) 0 0\n",
    "2) 0 1\n",
    "3) 0 2\n",
    "4) 0 3\n",
    "5) 1 1\n",
    "6) 1 2\n",
    "7) 1 3\n",
    "8) 2 2\n",
    "9) 2 3\n",
    "10) 3 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the answer is 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What to do in future?\n",
    "I didn't notice that it started at `y=x`, so I counted more pairs (16) and gave the wrong answer. I need to read the questions more carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 30\n",
    "### Question\n",
    "![Question 30 screenshot](https://i.ibb.co/KjfNtym6/image.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solving the Problem\n",
    "Trying out some sample testcases can give you an idea of which answer should be correct. It becomes clear that II is the correct solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What to do in future?\n",
    "I didn't notice that option I had `if` repeated three times instead of an `if-else if-else`, so I mistakenly thought it was correct. I need to look more slowly at the problem and how to solve it, and actually try some testcases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 38\n",
    "### Question\n",
    "![Question 38](https://i.ibb.co/TBkJwB7b/image.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solving the Problem\n",
    "Here, it's important to just try and plug in some example numbers and just see what happens as a result. It becomes clear that we add one each time we encounter `val`, so we're counting the amount of time `val` occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What to do in future?\n",
    "My mistake was that I didn't actually try plugging in numbers, if I took my time and did that I would've understood this better. Also, I overthought the problem and thought it was only adjacent values since I didn't plug in numbers to get a better idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 39\n",
    "### Question\n",
    "![Question 39](https://i.ibb.co/s7cBjCt/image.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solving the Problem\n",
    "If you understand that `ArrayList.set()` returns the old value, the answer is clear.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What to do in future?\n",
    "Better understand the methods of `ArrayList`s and other important classes in java."
