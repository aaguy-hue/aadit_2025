- 🤖 Made software for robots for the FIRST Tech Challenge (software lead of team Runtime Terror)
- 🧑‍💻 Made a platform to easily host CTFs (a type of cybersecurity competition)
- 💀 Created various Discord bots, some of which were used by hundreds of people

- 🗣️ Gave a presentation at the miRcore High School Research Conference
